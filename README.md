# Introduction
ITensor is a c++ library for implementing tensor network calculations  easily and efficiently. The home page of [ITensor](http://itensor.org).
It's easy to use ITensor in MacOS and Linux including the Windows subsystem for linux (WSL). This tutorial is mainly focus on the WSL alone with Ubuntu 16.04LTS which can be installed in the Windows App Store.
# Prepare Ubuntu
1. Turn on wsl:
* Right click on **PowerShell** and select Run as Administrator.
* Paste the following code and hit **return**.

  `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`
* Reboot system.
2. Search Ubuntu in the **Windows App Store** and install it.
3. Launch **bash** by the new created shortcut and creat your user name and password.
4. Go to [wsltty repository](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty/releases) download and install the lastest release version of **wsltty**. Use **wsltty** instead of default terminal for a better experience. If no shortcut created, creat it by hand.
* Right click on the desktop, select **New**>**Shortcut**
* Paste following code into the input box then **Next**

  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wsltty\bin\mintty.exe --wsl -o Locale=C -o Charset=UTF-8 /bin/wslbridge -C~ -t /bin/bash`
* Give this shortcut a name then **Finish**
5. Change default PPA in Ubuntu: replace all the context in /etc/apt/sources.list with lines generated @[mirrors.zju.edu.cn](http://mirrors.zju.edu.cn). open **wsltty**, run the following commands step by step:
* `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list`
* delete all contents
* go to [mirrors.zju.edu.cn](http://mirrors.zju.edu.cn), seletc **Ubuntu**>**16.04** then generate configuration
* paste lines generated by mirrors.zju.edu.cn (right click to paste)
* **CTRL+X** to exit nano and type **Y** to save
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install g++ make liblapack-dev`
# Install ITensor
- Download the tar.gz type file at [ITensor](http://itensor.org) home page. If the download path is D:\Downloads\.
- Move the downloaded file to your home directory

  `cd ~/`
  
  `mv /mnt/d/Downloads/ITensor-*.tar.gz ~/`
  
  `tar -xvf ITensor-*.tar.gz`
  
  `mv ITensor-* ITensor`
  
  `cd ITensor`
  > path and file name can be autocompleted by hitting **tab**, the above commands includes * which is a random string, you should use **tab** to autocomplete it.
- Modify make option file

  `cp options.mk.sample options.mk`
  
  `nano options.mk`

  comment the following two line (add #)
  ~~~~
  PLATFORM=macos
  BLAS_LAPACK_LIBFLAGS=-framework Accelerate
  ~~~~

  uncomment two line (delete #)
  ~~~~
  #PLATFORM=lapack
  #BLAS_LAPACK_LIBFLAGS=-lpthread -L/usr/lib -lblas -llapack
  ~~~~

  change
  ~~~~
  OPTIMIZATIONS=-O2 -DNDEBUG -Wall
  ~~~~
  to
  ~~~~
  OPTIMIZATIONS=-O3 -DNDEBUG -Wall
  ~~~~
  **CTRL+X** **Y** **return** to save the modified file.
- Compile ITensor

  `make`
  
  wait for compile process complete.
# Learn&Use ITensor
# Use
A simple DMRG code for a Ising chain can be found [here](https://pan.zju.edu.cn/share/).
Download and unzip all three files (**argv.txt**, **dmrgising</span>.cc**, and **Makefile**) to a place in **Windows**, e.g., D:\DMRG\

  `cd /mnt/d/DMRG`

  `make`

  `./dmrgising argv.txt 100 0.6`
> ./dmrgising is the program itself,
> argv.txt contains settings for dmrg,
> 100 is the chain length N,
> 0.6 is the the magnetic field strength hz.

When writting your own code in a file **owncode</span>.cc**, always put **Makefile** with it in the same directory and change

`APP=dmrgising`

to

`APP=owncode`

then you can type

`make`

to compile your code into binary file and run it.
# Learn
The folllowing tutorials should be learned step by step expect for the last one if you do not care about the implementations of ITensor.
- Basic C++ grammar: take a look at [this tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/).
- For a tensor fundamentals, see [The ITensor Book](http://itensor.org/docs.cgi?page=book).
- The ITensor [Tutorials](http://itensor.org/docs.cgi?page=tutorials) gives intuitive sense for beginners.
- [Code Formulas](http://itensor.org/docs.cgi?page=formulas) is a great reference when you write your own code based on ITensor.
- The details of ITensor library can be found [here](http://itensor.org/docs.cgi?page=classes), it's useful when you decide to take a look at the source code of ITensor.
